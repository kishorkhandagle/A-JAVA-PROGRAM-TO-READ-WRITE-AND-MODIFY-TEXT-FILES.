# The provided Java program is a File Handling Utility that enables users to perform three core file operations: writing, reading, and modifying (appending) text files. It uses the `java.io` package and employs efficient classes like `BufferedWriter` and `BufferedReader` for file I/O operations. The `writeToFile` method creates a file (if it doesn’t exist) and writes the specified content, while the `readFromFile` method reads and displays the file’s content line by line. The `modifyFile` method appends new content to an existing file without overwriting its current data. The program uses a menu-driven approach, allowing users to choose an operation by entering their file name and desired action. Proper error handling ensures that issues, such as missing files, are managed gracefully, while the use of try-with-resources ensures automatic stream closure to prevent resource leaks. This utility provides a simple, modular, and user-friendly way to manage text files for basic file manipulation needs.
